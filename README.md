## Project Goals
Our primary goal for this semester is to build a fun and engaging game called *Rabbit Run*. In this game, players will navigate each map and reach the exit, while collecting all the regular rewards on the map and reaching the level's score goal. The game ends once the enemy catches up with the player or the player collects enough punishments to obtain a score of zero or less.
